A simple javascript bullet hell game where you control the player with your mouse.
This was made through trial and error and without any javascript or web dev knowledge, so the quality may be very rough.

Planned features:
- Saving scores in local storage
- Multiple differentes levels with different bullet patterns
- Main menu between games
